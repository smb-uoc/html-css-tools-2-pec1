# PEC 1

This project contains the code for the evaluation PEC 1 of the  HTML and CSS Tools 2 course from the [Master's Program in Web App and Website Development](https://estudis.uoc.edu/ca/masters-universitaris/desenvolupament-llocs-aplicacions-web/presentacio) at the [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu).

In this PEC, I embark on the development of a website dedicated to the comarca of Vigo, a place with a rich history, stunning landscapes, and vibrant culture.

The page will provide information about the main points of interest in the comarca, including monuments, hiking routes, and other local attractions. Visitors will be able to explore what Vigo has to offer, with an attractive and responsive design that adapts to different devices.

## Requirements

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 18.x

## Getting started

Clone this repository with `git clone`, or download a .zip file using the top right green button.

Using the Terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`.

## Features

- Uses [Parcel v2](https://parceljs.org) module bundler.
- NPM scripts for fast development and production build (see Commands below).

### Stylesheets

- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) to CSS compilation.
- Minification and optimization of CSS files on production builds with [`cssnano`](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) (`@parcel/optimizer-cssnano`).
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) features:
  - Transpile modern CSS with [`postcss-preset-env`](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features).
  - Automatically add CSS prefix to unsupported properties with [`autoprefixer`](https://autoprefixer.github.io/).

### HTML

- Minification and optimization of CSS files on production builds [`htmlnano`](https://github.com/posthtml/htmlnano) (`@parcel/optimizer-htmlnano`).
- [PostHTML](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml) features:
  - Include partial HTML files with [`posthtml-include`](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml-include).

### Scripts

- Allow for modern JavaScript (ES201x/ES8/ES7/ES6…) which is automatically transpiled (for the older browsers set in the `package.json`) and minifed in production builds, with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

### Images

- Image transformation with [`@parcel/transformer-image`](https://parceljs.org/recipes/image/) (based on [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)).

### Development

- Development server launch and live reloading on file changes.
- Friendly error reporting.

## How to use this application

Content lives inside the `src/` folder. If you do not want to change the configuration or are unsure about what you are doing, do not edit files outside the `src/` folder.

Always run the following commands during the development stage and for production builds. Please note that it is expected that all projects built with this boilerplate are compiled using `npm run build` before they are published.

### Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Runs a local web server for development and opens the browser to display it. Automatically compiles styles and scripts whenever a file in `src/` is changed, and live reloads the browser. This is what _must be run_ on the development stage.                                                                                                                     |
| `npm run build` | Compiles and minifies and optimizes the files in the assets folder. The generated compiled and optimized files are located in the `dist/` folder. This is what _must be run_ before publishing the project. This is also the build command to be run by external deployment services such as Netlify. The publishable files are then located in the `dist/` folder. |
| `npm run clean` | Deletes the current `/dist` folder and cache folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `npm run test`  | Displays a success message if everything is working as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
